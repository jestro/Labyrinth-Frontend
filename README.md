# Labyrinth Frontend

A frontend for a web application game made with Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. This frontend was made as a part of a group project within bachelor studies and is meant to simulate games of [Labyrinth](https://www.ravensburger.org/ca-en/discover/labyrinth/index.html) together with the [backend](https://github.com/jestro/Labyrinth-Backend).

## How to set up? (local)

1. Clone frontend repository to your (I)DE.
2. Go into `config.js` and change the value of `SERVER_URL` to your backend URL.
3. Run `index.html` on a live server.

## Unique Game Modes

### Teleportation
Teleportation is not implemented yet. You can technically create a game with this game mode, but it will be the same as a simple game.
