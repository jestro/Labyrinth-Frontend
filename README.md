## Unique Game Modes
### Hardcore
Hardcore is a game mode we thought of during our project. This version disallows the player to rotate their spare tile.

### Teleportation
Teleportation is not implemented in our version of the project due to lack of context. You can technically create a game with this game mode, but it will be the same as a simple game.
